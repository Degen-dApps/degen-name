        DegenName.lol is a Web3 Social username service where anybody can mint their very own web3 domain username with a .degen extension.
      </p>

      <p>
        The .degen extension represents the Degen community. Once the username is minted it belongs to the user forever (no renewing fees).
      </p>

      <h3>
        Strengthening bonds within the Degen community
      </h3>

      <p>
        Many people are already using <code>.eth</code> names as usernames on Farcaster and other social media.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine the same happening for the Degen community. Having your own domain extension is good for spreading awareness and 
        it also strengthens bonds between members of the community.
      </p>

      <h3>
        More than just a domain
      </h3>

      <p>
        Web3 names are a digital identity. Degen community members can use domains as usernames when they log into web3 apps. They can also 
        attach additional data to a domain, like a website URL, or a Warpcast name, or email address. Or they can use domains to 
        easily send tokens and NFTs to each other.
      </p>

      <p>
        The DegenName.lol service is built on top of the Punk Domains protocol that is the go-to protocol for many big projects like 
        TreasureDAO's Smol Brains NFT community, PoolTogether, Giveth and more.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Many possible integrations
      </h3>

      <p>
        Any dApp or web3 frontend can easily integrate with <code>.degen</code> domain extensions.
      </p>

      <p>
        The protocol is completely permissionless and the code is open-sourced on our Github: 
        <a href="https://github.com/Degen-Dapps">https://github.com/Degen-Dapps</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>
        The road ahead
      </h3>

      <p>
        Web3 Social is arriving in a big way. There are many projects building different parts (lego blocks) of the upcoming Web3 Social.
      </p>

      <p>
        Usernames (aka "domains") are one of these building blocks. The whole idea is based on the fact that every user owns their 
        online identity and the content they produce (posts, comments, images, etc.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Web3 names are the integral part of Web3 Social. They mainly serve as usernames, but can also hold additional (optional) data 
        such as homepage URL, image data, email address, etc. Web3 names are digital identities and profiles in the web3 world.
